_In the short time span between the Great Void Before Birth and the Great Void After Death, I can think of no better
way of spending it than the respectful and collaborative creation of nude art. I am committed to create a safe working 
environment first, before anything else, this is paramount to achieve the free flowing of beauty, inspiration and 
creativity. For this, I want you to know that if you are working with me: you are my hero and you can count on me to
respect your boundaries at all times._ 

# My "official" musings on art and nudity

Hello and thanks for reading this. Since I have gotten into art as one of the main ways to spend my time, this topic 
has been brewing in my mind for quite a while. The body is the main subject of my artistic expressions, and the 
female body in particular. I'll go into the wy a bit further below, but I'll suffice here that I simply think it
is the most beautiful, aesthetic and expressive in the universe.

If you like to know what I do and make: have a look at my [sculptures](/pages/sculpture.html) page, and my photography
portfolio on [PurplePort](https://purpleport.com/portfolio/antfield).

There are several aspects of nudity and the human body that make it ideal for artistic expression. First of all, the
human nude is immediately recognised by most as separated from the usual cultural context. As "clothed
apes", humanity sets itself apart from the rest of nature, and nudity is mostly reserved for special occasions:
sleeping, washing, (sometimes) swimming, making love, the sauna. That's about it. Isn't that weird?

This inversion of unclothed nature (for better or worse) is to the artist's advantage: we can bring back the beauty of
the
human form _and_ set it aside from daily practice. In its artistic form, it's "OK" again to gaze at what we (literally)
shy away from. The artistic art nude creates its own context in which we can, to some limited and very temporary extent,
be re-acquainted with our beautiful, natural self.

Yes, I do believe that because of this cultural context, _any_ art nude portrayal carries some level of eroticism, even
(and sometimes more so) the fully implied nude.

## Photography

The focus in my photography usually is on art nude, but rarely
on ["bits"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_reproductive_system), also known as the human reproductive system. I 
don't believe that there's something wrong with bits (on the contrary), they are as beautiful as, or maybe even more
beautiful than any other part of the human body. But including them, for example, in photography shifts the focus
towards them. Bits tend to dominate the concept of the image, which is fine if it _is_ the concept.

## Sculpture

My sculptures do include bits, if they portray the nude human form. To purposefully exclude certain parts of the human
body in sculpture just seems silly to me. Because sculpture is already more abstract than photography, bits don't draw
as much attention. Another aspect is that the crotch isn't as easily hidden in sculpture as it is in photography: in 3D
you simply choose a different viewing angle. So: I wouldn't leave out an ear or a hand, why would I leave out bits in
sculpture and leave a human incomplete?
