# Creativity as the prime motivator

My creative endeavours are listed under my self-employment project "Antfield Creations". I make art to express myself 
emotionally and I make software to make a living and express myself cognitively. Together, they are my great outpourings
of creativity. The "art department" of my single-person institute works in sculpture and photography, the "research and
development department" does in software programming. 

The pages here, however, are on my artworks. For the engineering part, see
my [other site](https://reinvantveer.github.io).

NOTE that I have a ["proclaimer" on nudity in art](/pages/art-nude.html), as much of my art work revolves around this.

This is me, without make-up ðŸ˜œ:
