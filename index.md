# Creativity as the prime motivator

My creative endeavours are listed under my self-employment project "Antfield Creations". I make art and software, both
major expressions of creativity. The more obvious media, in sculpture and photography, but also in programming software.
Yes, software too: don't be mistaken - making software is much more a creative process and rarely a straightforward
translation of logic into machine-readable format.
