# Creativity as the prime motivator

My creative endeavours are listed under my self-employment project "Antfield Creations". I make art to express myself 
emotionally and I make software to make a living and express myself cognitively. Together, they are my great outpourings
of creativity. The "art department" of my single-person institute works in sculpture and photography, the "research and
development department" does in software programming.
